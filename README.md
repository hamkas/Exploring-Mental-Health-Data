## Dataset description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Depression Survey/Dataset for Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumansharmadataworld/depression-surveydataset-for-analysis) dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

## Public Score: 0.94109
There are many more improvement can be made. The first Kaggle competition for me personally.
